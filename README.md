# distracting-websites
A list of ALL the distracting websites.

This repository contains a list of distracting websites, primarily for use in the LeechBlock NG extension available for most major browsers.

My goal is to collect a list of every distracting website on the internet, with the important exception of [hmpg.net](http://hmpg.net).  Go visit it if you haven't already.

The internet should be a boring place where you go to do work, not a place where you go to waste time!  If you're going to do fun things on the internet, you should try to do them with other people so that you're more accountable for your time and don't regret how you've used it later on.

Anyway, enough soapboxing.  If you know a distracting website that isn't on the list, please please _please_ add it!!!  Prefix each site with an asterisk (\*) to block its subdomains, unless that is a bad idea in the case of a given specific site.  Keep everything in alphabetical order so that it's easier to check if anyone has added the website you're thinking of; if you paste the entire list into LeechBlock, add your entry, and hit "Save Options," it should automatically put it in the right spot.  Avoid editing this file on Windows, lest it add all those weird, superfluous newline characters.  But every little bit helps!

Thank you!  :-)
