# distracting-websites
A list of ALL the distracting websites.  Now blocking **723** separate web pages!

This repository contains a list of distracting websites, primarily for use in the LeechBlock NG extension available for most major browsers.

My goal is to collect a list of every distracting website on the internet, with the important exception of [hmpg.net](http://hmpg.net).  Go visit it if you haven't already.

The internet should be a boring place where you go to do work, not a place where you go to waste time!  If you're going to do fun things on the internet, you should try to do them with other people so that you're more accountable for your time and don't regret how you've used it later on.

Note that my putting a website in the list does not have any bearing on the approval of the website.  News websites in the list may be almost completely factual or almost completely fact-free.  Some of these websites I have never used; some I use way too much.  But I recognize that many websites can be borderline addictive, even ones I haven't checked out.

This list isn't intended to collect scam websites, but there might be some in there.  Again, I would really not suggest you go to all the websites in this list just for fun.  Even if your computer doesn't end up being hijacked for ransom, your brain might be.

Anyway, enough soapboxing.  If you know a distracting website that isn't on the list, please please _please_ add it!!!  In addition to adding each site you're thinking of by name, also add it prefixed with an asterisk and a period (\*.) to block its subdomains, unless that is a bad idea in the case of a given specific site.  Keep everything in alphabetical order so that it's easier to check if anyone has added the website you're thinking of; if you paste the entire list into LeechBlock, add your entry, and hit "Save Options," it should automatically put it in the right spot.  I'm not sure if LeechBlock sanitizes line endings to make them consistently either Windows or Unix-like, but right now I'm suggesting you not edit this on Windows so that the line endings are consistent.  But every little bit helps!

Thank you!  :-)
